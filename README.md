This is the final project developed for the **SheCodes Basic** workshop. The page is a tribute to cats, featuring fascinating facts about these animals and interactive resources for users.

* **Custom Design:** A modern layout featuring smooth color gradients, custom typography, and hover effects.
* **External Links:** Integration with Instagram, Spotify, and Netflix (via suggestions).


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the page.
