        Cats are (also) people's best friend!<br />
        <br />
        <em>This is defintely not a dog-exclusive position anymore.</em> Over
        time, people have become more open to the idea of bringing cats into
        their homes. They're clever, adorable, super tidy, and wonderfully
        independent, all while being incredibly affectionate. Cats are
        fascinating creatures with a rich history and unique characteristics.
        <br />
        <br />Here are 6 reasons to love them even more:
      </p>
      <ul class="List">
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Communication:</strong>
          Cats have a wide range of vocalizations, including meowing, purring,
          hissing, and chirping. They use these sounds to communicate with
          humans and other cats.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Purring Mysteries:</strong>
          While purring is often associated with contentment, cats also purr
          when they're in pain, stressed, or even giving birth. The exact reason
          for this behavior is still a subject of study and debate among
          scientists.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Night Vision:</strong>
          Cats have exceptional night vision due to a higher number of rod cells
          in their retinas. This adaptation allows them to see in light levels
          six times lower than what a human needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Whisker Magic:</strong>
          A cat's whiskers are highly sensitive and are used for navigation and
          detecting objects in the dark. They can also reveal a cat's mood; when
          a cat's whiskers are forward, they are curious, and when they're
          pulled back, the cat might be scared or agitated.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Cats are Liquid:</strong>
          Cats are known for their agility and balance. They have a flexible
          spine and lack a collarbone, which allows them to twist and squeeze
          through tight spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strong"> Clean Freaks:</strong>
          Cats are meticulous groomers, spending a significant portion of their
          waking hours cleaning themselves. This self-grooming helps regulate
          their body temperature and keep their fur clean.
